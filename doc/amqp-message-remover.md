## amqp-message-remover

Removes messages from AMQP queue selectively by regexp

### Synopsis

Removes messages from AMQP queue selectively. Matches message body by default against regular expression.
Only unacked messages can be processed. 
If you have to process all your queue - prefetch count must be equal to actual queue size.
Alternatively you can run this command in parallel with your normal consumer. In this case this command will remove
messages not consumed by another consumer.

```
amqp-message-remover [queue_name] [regex] [DSN] [options]
regex - regular expression without delimiters (example: .*some-bad-value.*).
DSN - amqp url specification, default is amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672
 [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --continuous     use this flag when running along with regular consumer, this is the same as if you rerun command continuously
      --headers        match headers instead of body, they will be serialized to json before matching
  -h, --help           help for amqp-message-remover
      --nack           use to unacknowledge messages, i.e. to send them to DLX
      --prefetch int   prefetch count, how many last messages to scan (or delete when 'continuous'); must not exceed actual queue size (default 1)
